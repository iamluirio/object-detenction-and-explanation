    "**Facial recognition** is an artificial intelligence technique, used in biometrics to identify or verify the identity of a person starting from one or more images that portray them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recognition usually occurs through digital image processing techniques, ignoring everything that does not represent a face, such as buildings, trees, bodies, which are usually called backgrounds. It can be said that it is a pattern recognition, where the pattern to be recognized is the human face.\n",
    "\n",
    "To facilitate the identification of a face, the first systems took into account that a human face is composed of two eyes, a nose and a mouth. The most recent systems, however, are able to recognize a person even if their face is rotated, or in any case not in frontal vision.\n"
